# üö® URGENT: Remove Text from PDF Document

## The Problem

When users sign a document, the backend is adding unwanted text directly to the PDF:

```
Jesal Shah <jesalshah234@gmail.com> signed at 2025-10-13T07:56:30.118Z
```

**Users DO NOT want this text on their PDF. They want ONLY their signature image.**

## What's Happening

1. User draws signature ‚úÖ
2. User places signature on PDF ‚úÖ  
3. Backend processes signature ‚úÖ
4. **Backend adds unwanted text to PDF** ‚ùå
5. User downloads PDF with unwanted text ‚ùå

## What Should Happen

1. User draws signature ‚úÖ
2. User places signature on PDF ‚úÖ
3. Backend processes signature ‚úÖ
4. **Backend adds ONLY signature image to PDF** ‚úÖ
5. User downloads clean PDF with only signature ‚úÖ

## Backend Code Fix Needed

**Find the code that adds signature text and disable it:**

```javascript
// REMOVE OR DISABLE THIS CODE:
function addSignatureToPDF(pdf, signature, placement, signerInfo) {
  // Add signature image (KEEP THIS)
  pdf.addImage(signature, placement.x, placement.y);
  
  // Add signature text (REMOVE THIS PART)
  pdf.addText(
    `${signerInfo.name} <${signerInfo.email}> signed at ${new Date()}`,
    placement.x, 
    placement.y + signatureHeight
  );  // ‚Üê DELETE THIS SECTION
}
```

**Change it to:**

```javascript
// FIXED VERSION:
function addSignatureToPDF(pdf, signature, placement, signerInfo) {
  // Add signature image ONLY
  pdf.addImage(signature, placement.x, placement.y);
  
  // DO NOT add any text
  // DO NOT add signer name
  // DO NOT add signer email  
  // DO NOT add timestamp
}
```

## Where to Look

The text is being added in your PDF generation code, likely in:

- Signature processing function
- PDF generation service
- Document signing endpoint
- Signature placement logic

Look for code that:
- Adds text after placing signature
- Includes signer name/email
- Adds timestamps
- Creates signature "labels" or "annotations"

## Test the Fix

1. **Before fix**: PDF shows signature image + text
2. **After fix**: PDF shows signature image ONLY
3. **Success**: No text anywhere on the PDF

## Priority: CRITICAL

This affects every signed document. Users are getting documents with text they never added and don't want.

**Please fix immediately by removing the text generation code from signature processing.**
